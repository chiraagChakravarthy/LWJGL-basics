we want to compute the angle a curve winds between two values of t

if we have a point, we can compute its absolute angle
if we take the difference between two angles, we obtain a relative angle
theta1 + dtheta = theta2
if both sides are normalized to [0,2pi], it is still true

we have 4 points
P0
P 1st stationary
P 2nd stationary
P1

betweeen each of these points, the angle is monotonic with respect to t, meaning it either only decreases or increases
compute the 2nd derivative at each of these points
if it is less than 0, then theta is decreasing between the current and next point
thus the delta theta between these points is negative
vise versa with positive 2nd derivative

thus we know whether the dtheta between these points is negative or positive
since the winding number is in range (-1,1) locally, we know dtheta is in range [-2pi, 2pi]
thus depending on whether it should be negative, and whether it is negative, we add or substract 2pi or 0 to the value of dtheta

we append this value of dtheta to a running sum
repeat for all the intervals
the end value should be the proper signed delta theta
if it isn't ill kms
